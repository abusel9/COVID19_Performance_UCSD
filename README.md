# COVID19_Performance_UCSD

Our analysis aimed to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the switch to online learning on student grades at UCSD. We
compared the average grades received across three time periods - pre-COVID, during COVID, and post-COVID. Our findings indicated that the
COVID period of online learning was associated with higher grades than the period before or after, but we observed an outlier in the Spring Quarter
of 2020 that may have skewed the results. Therefore, we performed a linear regression analysis to investigate the relationship between the time
period and average grades, controlling for confounding variables such as department membership and class recommendations. The results
showed a statistically significant positive effect of the COVID period on the average grade received, even after excluding the outlier, suggesting
that after professors and students adjusted to pandemic online learning, grades appeared to increase from the pre-pandemic time period. The
effect of the post-COVID period on the average grade received was statistically significant but not as pronounced as the effect of the COVID
period. These findings provide insights into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on student performance and can inform future decision-making
around online learning.
